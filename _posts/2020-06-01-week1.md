title: Week 1


As a part of the research plan, I spent the first weeks on reading research papers and articls to learn about different tool available to help student with learning database. 
On week one I studied the "SQL tester": This research paper about an online assesement tool for teaching and assessing SQL. Testing of basic SQL query language knowledge is completed with the SQL Tester as tested by Kleerekoper, et al. Students take practice tests and are allowed to revise their answers in a subsequent practice test. The output of SQL Tester illustrates four windows: 1) question, 2), database tables, 3) output from your query, and 4) desired output which allows the user to see results from the executed query. TriQL is similar in that it shows the query, the results from the query and the table schema. If a user repeats this process over time, in both cases students may become familiar with question semantics while also increasing their knowledge of SQL syntax, whereas TriQL also exposes the user to MongoDB and Neo4J and over time would presumably increase the user’s knowledge

On week 2: I Learned about The Backwash Effect on SQL Skills Grading by Julia Coleman Prior, Raymond Lister. 2014. The problem based learning approach along with the teacher’s grading methodology influences how deep a student’s knowledge is of SQL. Prior and Lister examine how an online grading tool used in their university department reviews student work. This differs from TriQL because the approach as the article name mentions backwash,  begins with the grading as the first dynamic assessed for learning and then designs lessons for learning SQL.
