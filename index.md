Advisor info goes here.Abdussalam Alawini is a Teaching Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His educational journey started with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Tripoli in 2002. He then worked in the industry for over six years as a database administrator, lead software developer, and IT Manager. In 2011, he returned to academia and received a master's in Computer Science and another master's degree in Engineering and Technology Management from Portland State University. He then received a doctoral degree in Computer Science from Portland State in 2016. In his Ph.D., he built systems to help scientists manage their file-based datasets by predicting relationships among spreadsheet documents. Passionate about a career in academia, Dr. Alawini joined the University of Pennsylvania in 2016 as a postdoctoral researcher. As a postdoc, he developed data citation and data provenance systems for scientists. Dr. Alawini's research interests are broadly in databases, applied machine learning, and education. He is particularly interested in applying machine learning methods to improve classroom experience and education in general.

## About My Project

Teaching Database with TriQL. 

"This project introduces TriQL, a system for helping novices learn the structures (schema) and query languages of three major database systems, including MySQL (a relational, SQL-Structured Query Language, database), Neo4J (a graph database), and MongoDB (a document/collection-oriented database). As part of this project, the student will be working on designing, developing and a conducting a user study to evaluate the learning effectiveness of TriQL. The first stage of this user study involves designing and delivering two database labs that use TriQL as part of the Summer 2022 offering of the Database Systems course (CS 411). In the second stage, we will conduct user interviews to quantitatively evaluate TriQL's learning outcomes and user experience."
